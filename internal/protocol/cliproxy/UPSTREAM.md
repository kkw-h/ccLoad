# CLIProxyAPI translator provenance

- Repository: `https://github.com/caidaoli/CLIProxyAPI`
- Module source path: `github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/v7`
- Last synchronized commit: `2c0d5b8d15f26afe6a79f726901c0b420b68b4ab` (`fork/v8.75.0`)
- Synchronized at: `2026-08-28`

This directory is maintained by one atomic synchronization operation. It currently
contains the four-protocol conversion core. Allowlisted provider-specific pure
translators enter `providers/` through that same operation; the provider section
below records what is actually present. Core and imported provider adapters always
share the same upstream commit and synchronization date. Authentication,
configuration, routing, cache services, plugins, dynamic registries, executors,
and network refreshers are intentionally excluded. ccLoad-specific generic wire
adaptation lives in `internal/protocol/builtin`.

The machine-readable core scope and the reviewed core/provider per-file delta
for the latest atomic synchronization live in
`.agents/skills/sync-cliproxy-core/references/core-snapshot.manifest`. Full sync
verification compares the previous immutable commit with the commit above and
fails on every unclassified or unstamped core change. The manifest deliberately
does not carry a second commit or date; the previous commit is anchored to the
version of this file stored in Git `HEAD` before the synchronization edits.

## Provider adapter snapshot

The canonical synchronization operation audits the semantic boundary in
`.agents/skills/sync-cliproxy-core/references/provider-adapters.md` and the sole
machine-readable file/exclusion/wiring/test allowlist in the adjacent
`provider-adapters.manifest`. Provider adapters are never synchronized in a
second pass or assigned an independent version.

Antigravity is the first eligible provider adapter:

- Upstream sources: `internal/translator/antigravity/{claude,gemini,openai/chat-completions,openai/responses}`
- Local destination: `internal/protocol/cliproxy/providers/antigravity`
- Snapshot status: synchronized at shared commit
- Excluded: dynamic `init.go` registration, noop/allocation tests, runtime cache/logging services, executors, auth, Interactions, and the two Claude request/response suites coupled to those runtime services
- Pure provider tests synchronized: 8; ccLoad HTTP wire contracts cover request, non-stream response, and stream response for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenAI clients

## Synchronized tests

The core snapshot includes 59 `_test.go` files from the same commit as the
production sources:

- `claude/gemini`: 2
- `claude/openai/chat-completions`: 3
- `claude/openai/responses`: 6
- `codex/claude`: 4
- `codex/gemini`: 2
- `codex/openai/chat-completions`: 2
- `codex/openai/responses`: 2
- `common`: 7
- `gemini/claude`: 3
- `gemini/openai/chat-completions`: 4
- `gemini/openai/responses`: 3
- `openai/claude`: 3
- `openai/gemini`: 2
- `openai/openai/responses`: 2
- `signature`: 8
- `util`: 6

Tests for excluded packages are not copied. Performance-only benchmarks are
also excluded: the translator-wide benchmark requires the excluded dynamic
Registry and Interactions paths, while the Claude-to-Codex
benchmark measures allocation details rather than a wire contract. Upstream
`noop_optimization_test.go` files and allocation-reuse assertions are likewise
excluded because they test private implementation and memory reuse instead of
the public conversion contract. The `thinking` package keeps only the pure
conversion sources (`convert.go`, `suffix.go`, `text.go`, `types.go`); upstream's
runtime thinking application (`apply.go`, `strip.go`, `summary.go`,
`validate.go`, `errors.go`, `provider/`) and its tests stay excluded, as does
the upstream SDK translator Registry and its summary test. The OpenAI-to-OpenAI
Chat Completions no-op converter and its post-`[DONE]` tests are excluded because
ccLoad's Registry defines same-protocol traffic as byte-for-byte passthrough and
never registers same-protocol converters.

## Local contract fixes

The snapshot is intentionally maintained in ccLoad instead of imported as a
runtime module. ccLoad carries protocol fixes required by its Registry contract,
including canonical Anthropic JSON/SSE non-stream responses, terminal SSE
events, cross-chunk tool arguments, reasoning/signature propagation, usage
details, and mixed Chat Completions/Responses ingress handling.

The synchronized tests keep their upstream behavior coverage, with only these
documented adaptations:

- module imports point at `ccLoad/internal/protocol/cliproxy`;
- the excluded upstream SDK Registry helper calls the exported core stream
  converter directly;
- assertions follow ccLoad's public wire contract for native non-stream JSON,
  Gemini camelCase fields, Codex top-level `instructions`, system-only prompts
  preserved as the sole user content, terminal `[DONE]`, protocol-specific
  cache-creation usage, and unsigned Anthropic thinking preserved as OpenAI
  reasoning.
- Codex-to-OpenAI Chat Completions maps cache-write usage to
  `prompt_tokens_details.cached_creation_tokens` in both streaming and
  non-streaming responses, and does not expose Codex encrypted reasoning
  carriers; readable reasoning summaries remain available as `reasoning_content`.
- Codex-to-Claude maps both top-level `cache_creation_input_tokens` and
  `input_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` to Anthropic
  `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and subtracts cache reads and writes from the
  reported uncached input count.
- Codex-to-Gemini requests keep the caller's `stream` flag and do not force
  `reasoning.summary`.
- OpenAI Chat Completions-to-Responses keeps ccLoad's custom-tool namespace and
  usage extensions around the synchronized terminal state machine. Plain-text
  streams may still complete on `[DONE]` without `finish_reason`; reasoning-only
  streams without an explicit finish and partial/invalid tool streams do not
  report false completion. All buffered tool states participate in that guard,
  even before an ID or name arrives. An explicit reasoning stop still completes,
  while `length` and `content_filter` terminate as `response.incomplete` even
  when no message or tool item was emitted.
- OpenAI Chat Completions-to-Codex maps `web_search_options` to a Responses
  `web_search` tool while preserving its search context and user location.
- Claude-to-Codex keeps top-level system text in `instructions`, supports the
  broader ccLoad URL/file/redacted-thinking input shapes, and omits an empty
  `input` array for instructions-only requests.
- Claude-target Responses requests carry a local string-`input` branch: the
  upstream converter only reads array `input`, so a plain string (legal in the
  Responses API) would silently translate to an empty message list. ccLoad maps
  it to a single user message, matching the Gemini- and OpenAI-target
  converters; the shared ccLoad request validator likewise accepts both shapes.
- Claude/OpenAI Responses now preserves server-side web search as a replayable
  `web_search_call`, including encrypted result carriers and citation indices.
  Streaming and non-streaming output keep text/search/text order and contiguous
  output indices. The pure core intentionally omits upstream debug logging.
- Claude Fable targets drop a trailing assistant prefill and synthesize a user
  fallback when that was the only turn; compatibility mode retains the prefill.
  Claude-to-OpenAI Chat Completions assigns tool calls their own zero-based,
  contiguous indices instead of leaking Anthropic content-block indices.
- Claude-to-Codex maps `output_config.format` JSON schema settings to Responses
  `text.format`. Gemini-to-Claude reports cached prompt tokens separately as
  `cache_read_input_tokens` and subtracts them from uncached input tokens.
- Claude-to-Gemini preserves an absent adaptive effort and performs the
  excluded runtime `ApplyThinking` level normalization inline: exact target
  levels are retained, unsupported valid levels are clamped to the nearest
  declared level (lower wins ties), and Antigravity level-suffixed Gemini model
  names resolve capabilities through their base model.
- Claude Responses native non-stream JSON keeps ccLoad request-field echoing,
  cache-creation and reasoning usage details, and the same marked
  redacted-thinking carrier used by the synchronized SSE path.
- Gemini Responses `[DONE]` finalization is upstream behavior as of
  `fork/v8.57.0`; the previously documented local divergence was adopted
  upstream.
- Gemini signature sanitization keeps upstream signature ownership and parallel
  function-call semantics without importing its runtime debug logger.
- Antigravity adapters keep only request-local conversion state. Runtime signature
  caches, dynamic model registries, and logging side effects remain outside the
  provider packages; OpenAI summary aliases are normalized locally as wire data.
  Claude-target finalization preserves compatible Claude thinking signatures and
  assigns Antigravity's validator-bypass signature to the first function call in
  each model turn; parallel sibling function calls remain unsigned. All supported
  ingress paths converge on this rule, preventing sequential tool history from
  being rejected before execution.
  The shared Antigravity wire finalizer also performs the excluded runtime
  `ApplyThinking` effort-alias normalization (`minimal` to `low`, `xhigh`/`max`
  to `high`) for every client protocol before the request is sent.
  At `fork/v8.75.0`, upstream's Claude response adapter also tries to cache
  trailing signature-only carriers with an empty thinking-text key. Its cache
  rejects empty text, making those calls no-ops; ccLoad has no runtime signature
  cache and keeps the existing pure wire carrier path instead.
- Antigravity stream payloads are framed at the app boundary because the upstream
  executor normally supplies SSE delimiters; ccLoad writes provider chunks directly.
  The same boundary supplies the Gemini converter's legacy `ctx["alt"]` mode value;
  without it the synchronized converter intentionally emits no stream chunks.
  The app boundary preserves the client's streaming mode when choosing
  `generateContent` versus `streamGenerateContent`; both modes share the same
  ordered provider base-URL fallback policy.
- Executor/runtime parity remains implemented at the app boundary rather than in
  this snapshot. Antigravity uses refresh-token-scoped HTTP/1.1 pools with native
  keepalive limits and bounded LRU eviction. Its runtime User-Agent is resolved
  once at startup from the official Hub updater manifest, falls back to Hub 2.8.1,
  and is shared by data, project/model, and quota requests (the OAuth token
  endpoint retains its native client UA); its request finalizer performs one
  object-tree rewrite per attempt. Claude OAuth preserves confirmed native and
  measured Haiku-helper request shapes, owns cache placement only for cloaked
  callers, rejects legacy mid-conversation system messages locally for Anthropic's
  first-party origin, and removes only automatically injected context management
  that outlives eligible thinking.
  The excluded plugin registry and Antigravity reasoning replay cache still have
  no ccLoad runtime equivalent, so plugin-hook and replay-index changes are not
  copied as translator code.
- ccLoad has no Kimi OAuth authenticator or executor. The upstream
  `models.json` may still include a top-level kimi catalog; ccLoad's
  `modelCatalog` does not deserialize that key, so Lookup never sees those
  models. Generic API-key channels remain model-agnostic and retain Kimi
  pricing and wire-format compatibility.
- `fork/v8.65.0` also rewrites Gemini function-call pairing validation to use
  short-circuiting `gjson.ForEach`; ccLoad carries that pure control-flow update
  while preserving its local `ccLoad/internal/protocol/cliproxy/util` import and
  established error strings.
- The target snapshot's Responses-to-Chat conversion still keeps ccLoad wire
  extensions for `reasoning.content`, cache-creation usage, `input_file`, and
  Responses `web_search` to `web_search_options`; these are intentional local
  contract differences and must survive future upstream syncs.
- Claude-target request converters derive a deterministic `metadata.user_id`
  from caller-supplied identity or stable request signals (prompt cache key,
  session/conversation ID, or the first user prompt). Explicit caller values
  remain unchanged; no process-global mutable identity or credential state is
  introduced.
- Responses tool namespace discovery and sanitization live in the pure
  `util/responses_tools.go` helper. Top-level declarations win over
  `additional_tools`, namespace children retain qualified names, and the
  helper carries no runtime registry or network dependency.
- The embedded capability catalog exposes Antigravity models to Gemini wire
  conversion. `gemini-3.7-flash-high` follows the canonical entry added by
  `router-for-me/models` commit `cbe1e6c59429bc92dd8d6654873670fc0c274cad`;
  that catalog provenance is independent of the CLIProxyAPI snapshot commit above.
- `util/gemini_schema.go` and its test carry four lint-forced equivalent
  rewrites required by ccLoad's zero-warning `golangci-lint` gate:
  `escapeGJSONPathKey` uses `strings.ContainsAny` instead of upstream's
  `strings.IndexAny(...) == -1` (staticcheck S1003), `mergeDescriptionRaw` uses a
  tagged `switch` (QF1002), and the test's two `json.Unmarshal` calls check their
  error (errcheck). Behavior is identical to upstream; each site is annotated
  in place.
  The synchronized cleaner also handles `contains` hints, preserves parent object
  properties while flattening `anyOf`/`oneOf`, prefers typed union branches over
  untyped/null shells, and removes orphan `required` arrays.
- `util/claude_attribution.go` and its test are now part of the snapshot. The
  previous `private-helper-test` exclusion no longer holds: the file is an
  exported pure string transform on Claude system prompts, and its test asserts
  that public contract. Its sole upstream caller stays in the excluded runtime
  executor layer, so the function has no ccLoad call site yet, exactly like
  `CleanJSONSchemaForAntigravityTool`.
- `util/header_helpers.go` and its test are excluded as runtime HTTP helpers.
  The target revision makes the file depend on `github.com/gin-gonic/gin`, which
  confirms it belongs to upstream's HTTP serving layer rather than the pure
  conversion core.

## Updating from CLIProxyAPI

Run this procedure through the repository skill: use `$sync-cliproxy-core` in
Codex or `/sync-cliproxy-core` in Claude Code. Both entry points resolve to the
canonical skill under `.agents/skills/sync-cliproxy-core`.

1. Fetch the ccLoad CLIProxyAPI fork and choose one immutable commit or tag.
2. Generate one combined diff for the four-protocol core and every provider in
   the canonical allowlist. All production sources and tests must come from that commit.
3. Copy changed pure conversion files and matching tests only; do not add a Go
   module import, `replace`, authentication, configuration, routing, cache services,
   plugins, SDK registries, executors, or network update code.
4. Port provider-specific pure request/response semantics into `providers/<provider>`
   and connect request, non-stream response, and stream response paths. Keep
   Interactions excluded until ccLoad supports that public wire protocol.
5. Resolve the combined diff against Registry and provider wire contracts. If any
   domain cannot be integrated or tested, leave the whole synchronization incomplete.
6. After core, all providers, production wiring, and tests pass, update the single
   shared commit and date above once.
7. Run the core scope verifier self-test, then run the atomic verifier with the
   previous synchronized commit as `--base-commit`.
8. Run `go test -tags sonic ./internal/protocol/cliproxy/...`,
   `go test -tags sonic ./internal/protocol`, and the repository verification
   commands from `CLAUDE.md`.

The upstream core/provider tests prove the snapshot was synchronized without
losing conversion behavior. Registry and provider boundary tests remain ccLoad's
compatibility authority. A future upstream sync is incomplete if either layer
fails, any of the 12 core request/non-stream/stream directions regresses, or an
allowlisted provider is omitted.
